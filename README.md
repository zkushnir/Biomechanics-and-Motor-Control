# Biomechanics-and-Motor-Control

The course provides an introduction into the mechanics and control of legged locomotion with a focus on the human system. The main topics covered include fundamental concepts, muscle-skeleton mechanics, and neural control. Examples of bio-inspiration in robots and rehabilitation devices are highlighted. The course develops the material in parallel with an introduction into Matlabs Simulink and SimMechanics environments for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems.
